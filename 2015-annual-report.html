<h1>SchoolTool 2015 Annual Report<a class="headerlink" href="#schooltool-2015-annual-report" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>by Tom Hoffman, Managing Partner, <a class="reference external" href="http://sielibre.com">SIELibre, LLC</a></p>
<p>While Mark Shuttleworth was funding SchoolTool development, each year I
prepared an annual report for him.  While Mark’s generous support ended after
2014, I have decided to continue this tradition now that SchoolTool’s open
source development is funded by SIELibre and our clients.</p>
<p>The most important point is that we have been able to continue SchoolTool
development independently throughout 2015. Douglas Cerna worked full time and
more on SchoolTool through 2015 and plans to continue into 2016.  I have
continued managing the product and our new business.</p>
<section id="ark">
<h2>ARK<a class="headerlink" href="#ark" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We began collaborating with <a class="reference external" href="http://arkonline.org/">Absolute Return for Kids (ARK)</a>, a London-based charity, during 2014.  ARK was SIELibre’s primary client throughout 2015.  They kept us very busy.  In the past 18 months, ARK has deployed customized versions of SchoolTool to three groups of schools in three countries: Uganda, Sierra Leone and India.</p>
<p>While ARK directly manages a successful chain of academies in England, <a class="reference external" href="http://arkonline.org/programmes/school-information-systems">their work with SchoolTool</a> has been on a consulting and support basis with networks of schools managed by other organizations, including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peas.org.uk/">PEAS (Promoting Equality in African Schools)</a>, a “charity/social enterprise hybrid” running schools in Uganda and Zambia, and the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/risingacademies">Rising Academy Network,</a> a new network of affordable, high quality and innovative schools in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Networks of low-cost private schools in developing countries fit well with SIELibre’s business model, which is focused on custom development, not licensing.  Customizing SchoolTool can be expensive for one school, but spread out over a growing group of schools, it is manageable, especially to social enterprises which put a high value on collecting data and monitoring the performance of their investments.</p>
<p>Free software licensing allows the networks to continue to use their customized software indefinitely and across a growing number of schools at no additional cost, helping the networks continue as largely self-funded after an initial burst of charitable support at launch.  We provide paid tier 3 support to the networks, currently through ARK’s support staff, at a flat per network rate which does not increase as number of schools in the network grows.  So far, this model seems to be working out for everyone.</p>
<p>ARK and their client networks are completely supportive of our making the improvements to SchoolTool that they have funded available in future SchoolTool releases.  The packages we have created for them and all source code are available as free software on the <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/schooltool-project">SchoolTool project site on Launchpad</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~sielibre">SIELibre’s Launchpad PPAs,</a> but aren’t practically useful at other schools until we can merge the changes into a generalized, public release.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-clients">
<h2>Other Clients<a class="headerlink" href="#other-clients" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2015 we have created specialized versions of SchoolTool for several clients, such as a US-based online learning company, a foundation tracking a program to support high school students applying to post-secondary education across several schools in a US state, and an initiative to provide online test preparation to schools in Liberia.</p>
<p>While we do not see hosting as our primary business, we do provide paid hosting and support to several individual schools in different parts of the world that do not wish to host SchoolTool themselves.</p>
</section>
<section id="schooltool-3-0">
<h2>SchoolTool 3.0<a class="headerlink" href="#schooltool-3-0" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I had originally hoped to make a SchoolTool 3.0 release in early January 2014 to mark the transition from philanthropic funding from Mark Shuttleworth releases made independently by SIELibre.  The bad news is that this release kept getting pushed back; the good news is that during the year we developed many important features and improvements that will be included in the eventual 3.0 release.</p>
<p>Most of the new features in the upcoming SchoolTool 3.0 release have been developed with and for ARK and have been tested and used extensively in the field during 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p>These features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Student fee tracking, including recurring fees;</p></li>
<li><p>AM/PM student attendance (taken once or twice a day);</p></li>
<li><p>Daily teacher attendance and substitute teacher assignment;</p></li>
<li><p>Support for more complex course exam management and reporting (“assesment sets”);</p></li>
<li><p>Simple disciplinary incident reports;</p></li>
<li><p>User Customizable Excel exports;</p></li>
<li><p>Improved support for student promotion and graduation;</p></li>
<li><p>Easier transition to a new school year;</p></li>
<li><p>Student “streams” to easily create multiple sections for the same group of students;</p></li>
<li><p>One step to enroll and un-enroll students;</p></li>
<li><p>Notes can be added to student and teacher profiles;</p></li>
<li><p>Many new reports.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>SIELibre also completely redesigned the main administration screen (under the School tab) for much better usability and streamlining frequent tasks.</p>
<p>The limiting factor in getting this work into general release has simply been time.  ARK has kept us jumping with hard deadlines for their various deployments, and we also had to prioritize diversifying our client base in our first year as an independent business.  Their schools in Africa begin a new school year in January and February, and once we complete a set of changes for their new year, we should be able to focus on preparing the 3.0 release.  Our goal is to have a release ready by the end of March 2016.</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-forward">
<h2>Looking Forward<a class="headerlink" href="#looking-forward" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our focus is on taking care of our pending obligations and getting SchoolTool 3.0 out.  At that point, we will be promoting both the release and our successes with ARK and their client schools.  Our biggest goal for 2015 is getting beyond being completely dependent on Douglas Cerna as the sole developer, whether through hiring, new partnerships, open source community building or joining a larger company.</p>
