Grade Levels
============

Grade levels describe the progress of students through the school.  They may 
also be assigned to courses to describe their difficulty and place in the
curricular sequence.

We will use the grade level sequence of an American secondary high school 
in this example: grades 9 through 12.

To create Grade Levels, you must be logged in as a member of **Clerks** or 
**Site Managers**. Select the **School** tab, and click on **Grade Levels**, 
under **Customize**:

And so we'll create the rest of the levels.

The *order* of the levels is significant.  Levels are considered to represent
a single linear sequence.  If you need to adjust the order, click **Actions > 
Reorder or Delete Levels**:
