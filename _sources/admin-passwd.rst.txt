Changing the Management Password
================================

The first step is to log in as the "Default Manager," do a little basic 
customization and create a user account for yourself.  So first go to http://localhost:7080.  You should see a blank calendar like this:

Click **Log In** at the right end of the gray bar, and click the **Log in** 
button after entering "manager" as the **Username** and "schooltool" as the **Password**:

Next you should change the "Default Manager"'s password.  First click on 
**Home** at the top of the screen:

   .. image:: images/admin-passwd-2.png

Then click on **Password** under settings in the left sidebar.

Enter the current password ("schooltool"), enter a new one (twice), and click **Apply**.

The success message:

Even if you don't plan to make your SchoolTool server's web pages accessible 
from another computer, you should reset the "Default Manager" password to 
prevent another person with physical access to your computer from accessing 
your SchoolTool data with the default password.
