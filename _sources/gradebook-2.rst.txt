Managing Multiple Activities, Categories, Worksheets
====================================================

Multiple Activities
-------------------

Now, we will make a second activity and score it:

As you can see, after you **Update** the changes, the **Total** and **Average** columns are also updated.

If you want to change the order of the columns, you can select **Move Left** or **Move Right** from each activity's contextual menu.

Weighting Categories
--------------------

The most straightforward way of maintaining a point-based gradebook, like SchoolTool's, is to assign the number of points according to the importance of the assignment.  For example, a weekly quiz might be worth 10 points and a major exam worth 100.  If you do it this way, you don't have to weight categories.

On the other hand, if you want to score all types of assignments the same -- say you want to assign percentage scores to both weekly quizzes and major exams -- then you may need to weight by category.  For example, quizzes are worth 25% of the grade and exams worth 75%.  If weighting categories doesn't make sense to you, you probably don't need to weight categories.

If you don't need or want to weight categories, you can skip the rest of this section.

Categories are weighted *by worksheet*.  So this must be defined on each worksheet.

While viewing the relevant worksheet, click **Settings: Category Weights** in the sidebar.  Enter the weight of each category by typing numbers in the available fields.  The sum of the weights must total 100.

In the above case, exams are 75% of the calculated average, quizzes are 25%.

Click on **Submit** and the scores will reflect the new weights:

Multiple Worksheets
-------------------

You can create multiple worksheets to organize your work in various ways.  One straightforward use is if the section is defined by a semester which is divided into two grading quarters, each quarter might be assigned its own worksheet.

First we'll change the name of the default "Sheet1."  Click on the **Settings: Worksheets** link:

   .. image:: images/gradebook2-5.png

Then, click on the yellow pencil icon next to to "Sheet1" and switch the name to something more descriptive:

Click on **Submit** to finalize your edit:

Now we'll add a second worksheet.  Click on **Done**, and from the main gradebook view click **Add: Worksheet**:

   .. image:: images/gradebook2-8.png

Click on **Submit**.  Now you've got two tabs, with the new (empty) worksheet active:

   .. image:: images/gradebook2-9.png

Add a new activity as we did above and score it:

You can add a summary worksheet to each of your Gradebooks that automatically includes a column for the average of all existing worksheets.  From the main Gradebook page, go back to **Settings: Worksheets** and click on **Create summary worksheet**:

The summary sheet should look like this:
