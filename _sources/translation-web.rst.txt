Translating SchoolTool.org
==========================

The landing page at http://schooltool.org is a static HTML page.  

To create a local translation, you can simply **Save as...** the HTML source from your browser, translate the body text, and send the file as an attachment to `Tom Hoffman <mailto:hoffman@schooltool.org>`_.  

If you'd like to use bzr to help track changes made to the site over time, you can check out the sources to the pages at::

    bzr branch lp:~schooltool-owners/schooltool/schooltool-org

Or even::

    bzr branch http://www.schooltool.org

We will take care of deploying the translations to the web server.
