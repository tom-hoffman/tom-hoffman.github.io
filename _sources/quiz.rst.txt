SchoolTool Quiz
---------------

Jeff Elkner has been funding (personally!) Douglas Cerna to create a system
attached to CanDo that allows teachers to create online quizzes for their
students.  Individual questions can be tagged with skills in CanDo to
automatically update a student's skill rating in the gradebook based on quiz
results.
