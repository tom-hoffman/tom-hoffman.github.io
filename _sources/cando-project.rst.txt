Using Project Worksheets
========================

The "Skills" view of a teacher's CanDo gradebook is organized by Skill Sets assigned to the course.

The "Projects" view allows teachers to add individual skills to a section, and organize them freely.  

.. NOTE::
   
   Scores entered in the **Projects** worksheets are "inherited" by the **Skill Set** worksheets, but not vice versa.  For example, if Skill A has a score of "2" in the **Skill Set** worksheet, and a new Project is created containing Skill A, no score will appear in the Project worksheet.  This reflects the fact that the Project has not been evaluated, the skill has not been evaluated in the context of the project.  The Score History in the Project worksheet only shows the scores entered in the project.
   
   Once Skill A is evaluated in the project, the core will also appear in the **Skill Sets** view and Score History.  If it is subsequently updated in the **Skill Sets** view, the score in the **Projects** worksheet will not be updated.

Adding Skills to Projects
-------------------------

Click the **View: Projects** radio button in the left sidebar:

This includes an empty default project called "Project1".  We will rename this to "Hands-On."  Click on **Settings: Projects** in the left sidebar:

And on the yellow edit pencil next to **Project1**:

Click **Submit**:

And **Done** to return to the gradebook:

To add a Skill to the current project, click **Add: Skill** in the left sidebar.  Use the form to search for the skill you would like to add.  You can use the checkboxes to select specific layers in the skills hierarchy.

.. WARNING::
   
   This search is currently buggy.  You can only reliably search for Skill Sets.

Clicking on the title of the Skill, Skill Set or other node will take you to a form displaying a Skill Set or list of Skill Sets.

In this case, you see the Basic Geometry Skill Set.  We'll select "Identify and explain basic Trigonometric functions and their application in determining lengths and angles."  You could also add other Skills from this set at this time if you wished.  

Click **Submit**:

The skill has been added to the project.

You can now add additional skills from different Skill Sets, different Documents, or even newly created ones.

The Skills in the **Project** view are scored just like the **Skill Set** view.
