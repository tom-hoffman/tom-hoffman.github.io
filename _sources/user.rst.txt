Creating a User Account
=======================

All user accounts in the SchoolTool system are referred to as People.  :ref:`roles`, along with associated permissions and access privileges, may be provisioned by adding people to :ref:`groups`.  

To create a new Person account, you must be logged in as a member of **Clerks** or **Site Managers**. Select the **School** tab at the top of the page, then click on **People** to end up here:

Under **Add** in the sidebar, you have shortcuts for some common Groups, such as **School Administrators, Students,** and **Teachers**. Selecting the generic user role, **Person**, allows you to choose a different initial Group, or no Group, for the new user account.  We'll just use the basic **Add: Person** form this time:

Most of the fields are optional, except for the fields marked with green asterisks: **first name**, **last name**, and **username**.  For now, just put in your basic information and a password.  We'll go into much more detail concerning the rest of this form later.

Click **Submit** and you should see:

You should now be able to **Log Out** by following the link at the upper right, and **Log In** as your new user, at which point you should see the Person's calendar (if you haven't changed the default view under :ref:`server-settings`).
