Changes in SchoolTool 2.8
=========================

Adding and removing members
----------------------------

From a user interface point of view, the biggest change to SchoolTool 2.8 is 
in the screens that add and remove people from "relationships," such as group 
memberships, as instructors or students enrolled in a section, or creating a 
contact relationship between a student and their guardian.  

There are two parts to the change:

    * the interface itself uses checkboxes so you can add/remove/edit multiple 
      people at a time;
 
    * when modifying the relationship you must indicate the type of change 
      taking place, for example, if a student has withdrawn as a student or 
      graduated.

For the generic example, we will look at adding a person to the **Students** 
group.  A student's enrollment status within the school is indicated by their 
membership in the **Students** group.

If we navigate to the **Students** group, and click the edit pencil next to 
**Members**, we see the new form:

To change the status of one or more current students, for example, to 
"Withdrawn," check the boxes next to their names, and select **Withdrawn** 
under **Set selected to**.  You may also set the date of the change, which 
defaults to the current date.

Click **Update**:

Note that you cannot completely remove a person from a group or section.  
Making a relationship inactive will omit the person from most relevant 
views by default.  If a membership or other relationship is a mistake, use 
the "Added in error" status to indicate this.

Adding students, or adding and editing other group memberships or relationships 
is similar.

On the **School** page, under **Customize**, you can select **Membership 
States** to customize the states of different types of relationships.

For example, click **Student Enrollment**.

In each type of relationship, there are a few pre-set "meanings" that 
may affect underlying functionality important to SchoolTool.  For example,
the basic statuses of student enrollment are defined as:

    * Active (an enrolled student)
    * Inactive (not an enrolled student)
    * Pre-enrolled (essentially an unenrolled applicant or future student)
    * Graduated/Inactive (completed the program and unenrolled)
    * Graduated/Active (completed the program but still enrolled as a stuent)

In addition to these "meanings," you can create additional statuses with their 
own Title and Code.  For example, in this form you could add an inactive 
"Transferred" status.
